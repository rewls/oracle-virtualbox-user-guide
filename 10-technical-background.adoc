= 10 Technical Background

* This chapter provides additional information for readers who are familiar
  with computer architecture and technology and want to find out more about how
  Oracle VirtualBox works under the hood.
* The contents of this chapter are not required reading in order to use Oracle
  VirtualBox successfully.

== 10.1 Where Oracle VirtualBox Stores its Files

* In Oracle VirtualBox, a virtual machine and its settings are described in a
  virtual machine settings file in XML format.
* In addition, most virtual machines have one or more virtual hard disks.
* These are typically represented by disk images, such as those in VDI format.
* The location of these files may vary, depending on the host operating system.
* See _10.1.1 The Machine Folder_.

'''

* Global configuration data for Oracle VirtualBox is maintained in another
  location on the host.
* See _10.1.2 Global Settings_.

=== 10.1.1 The Machine Folder

* By default, each virtual machine has a directory on your host computer where
  all the files of that machine are stored: the XML settings file, with a
  `.vbox` file extension, and its disk images.
* This is called the _machine folder_.
* By default, this machine folder is located in a common folder called
  `VirtualBox VMs`, which Oracle VirtualBox creates in the current system user's
  home directory.
* The location of this home directory depends on the conventions of the host
  operating system, as follows:
** On Linux, macOS, and Oracle Solaris, this is generally taken from the
   environment variable `$HOME`, except for the user `root` where it is taken
   from the account database.
*** This is a workaround for the frequent trouble caused by users using Oracle
	VirtualBox in combination with the tool `sudo`, which by default does not
    reset the environment variable `$HOME`.
+
'''
*** A typical location on Linux and Oracle Solaris is `/home/_username_` and on
	macOS is `/Users/_username_`.

'''

* For simplicity, we abbreviate the location of the home directory as `$HOME`.
* Using that convention, the common folder for all virtual machines is
  `$HOME/VirtualBox VMs`.

'''

* As an example, when you create a virtual machine called _Example VM_, Oracle
  VirtualBox creates the following:
** A machine folder: `$HOME/VirtualBox VMs/Example VM/`
** In the machine folder, a settings file: `Example VM.vbox`
** In the machine folder, a virtual disk image: `Example VM.vdi`.

'''

* This is the default layout if you use the *Create New Virtual Machine* wizard
  described in _1.9 Creating a Virtual Machine_.
* Once you start working with the VM, additional files are added.
* Log files are in a subfolder called `Logs`, and if you have taken snapshots,
  they are in a `Snapshots` subfolder.
* For each VM, you can change the location of its snapshots folder in the VM
  settings.

'''

* You can change the default machine folder by selecting *Preferences* from the
  *File* menu in the Oracle VirtualBox main window.
* Then, in the displayed window, click the *General* tab.
* Alternatively, use the `VBoxManage setproperty machinefolder` command.
* See _VBoxManage setproperty_.
