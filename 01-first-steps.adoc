* Oracle VirtualBox is a cross-platform virtualization application.
* That means it extends the capabilities of your existing computer so that it
  can run multiple operating systems, inside multiple virtual machines (VMs),
  at the same time.
* You can install and run as many virtual machines as you like.
* The only practical limits are disk space and memory.

'''

* Oracle VirtualBox is deceptively simple yet also very powerful.
* It can run everywhere from small embedded systems or desktop class machines
  all the way up to data center deployments and even Cloud environments.
* In this User Guide, we will begin simply with a quick introduction to
  virtualization and how to get your first virtual machine running with the
  easy-to-use Oracle VirtualBox graphical user interface.
* Subsequent chapters will go into much more detail covering more powerful
  tools and features, but fortunately, it is not necessary to read the entire
  User Guide before you can use Oracle VirtualBox.

== 1.1 Why is Virtualization Useful?

* The techniques and features that Oracle VirtualBox provides are useful in the
  following scenarios:
Running multiple operating systems simultaneously.::
** Oracle VirtualBox enables you to run more than one OS at a time.
** This way, you can run software written for one OS on another, such as
   Windows software on Linux or a Mac, without having to reboot to use it.
** Since you can configure what kinds of virtual hardware should be presented
   to each such OS, you can install an old OS such as DOS or OS/2 even if your
   real computer's hardware is no longer supported by that OS.
Easier software installations.::
** Software vendors can use virtual machines to ship entire software
   configurations.
** For example, installing a complete mail server solution on a real machine
   can be a tedious task.
** With Oracle VirtualBox, such a complex setup, often called an appliance, can
   be packed into a virtual machine.
** Installing and running a mail server becomes as easy as importing such an
   appliance into Oracle VirtualBox
Testing and disaster recovery::
** Once installed, a virtual machine and its virtual hard disks can be
   considered a container that can be arbitrarily frozen, woken up, copied, backed
   up, and transported between hosts.
+
'''
** Using virtual machines enables you to build and test a multinode networked
   service, for example. +
** Issues with networking, operating system, and software configuration can be
   investigated easily.
+
'''
** In addition to that, with the use of another Oracle VirtualBox feature
   called snapshots, one can save a particular state of a virtual machine and
   revert back to that state, if necessary.
** This way, one can freely experiment with a computing environment.
** If something goes wrong, such as problems after installing software or
   infecting the guest with a virus, you can easily switch back to a previous
   snapshot and avoid the need of frequent backups and restores.
+
'''
** Any number of snapshots can be created, allowing you to travel back and
   forward in virtual machine time.
** You can delete snapshots while a VM is running to reclaim disk space.

Infrastructure consolidation.::
* Virtualization can significantly reduce hardware and electricity costs.
* Most of the time, computers today only use a fraction of their potential
  power and run with low average system loads.
* A lot of hardware resources as well as electricity is thereby wasted.
* So, instead of running many such physical computers that are only partially
  used, one can pack many virtual machines onto a few powerful hosts and
  balance the loads between them.

== 1.2 Some Terminology

* When dealing with virtualization, and also for understanding the following
  chapters of this documentation, it helps to acquaint yourself with some
  important terminology, especially the following terms:
Host operating system (host OS).::
** This is the OS of the physical computer on which Oracle VirtualBox was
   installed.
** There are versions of Oracle VirtualBox for Windows, macOS, Linux, and
   Oracle Solaris hosts.
+
'''
** Most of the time, this user guide discusses all Oracle VirtualBox versions
   together.
** There may be platform-specific differences which we will point out where
   appropriate.

Guest operating system (guest OS).::
** This is the OS that is running inside the virtual machine.
** Theoretically, Oracle VirtualBox can run any x86 OS such as DOS, Windows,
   OS/2, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD on an x86 host.
** But to achieve near-native performance of the guest code on your machine, we
   had to go through a lot of optimizations that are specific to certain OSs.
** So while your favorite OS may run as a guest, we officially support and
   optimize for a select few, which include the most common OSs.
+
'''
* See _3.1 Guest Operating Systems_.

Virtual machine (VM).::
** This is the special environment that Oracle VirtualBox creates for your
   guest OS while it is running.
** In other words, you run your guest OS in a VM.
** Normally, a VM is shown as a window on your computer's desktop.
** Depending on which of the various frontends of Oracle VirtualBox you use, the
   VM might be shown in full screen mode or remotely on another computer.
+
'''
** Internally, Oracle VirtualBox treats a VM as a set of parameters that specify
   its behavior.
** Some parameters describe hardware settings, such as the amount of memory and
   number of CPUs assigned.
** Other parameters describe the state information, such as whether the VM is
   running or saved.
+
'''
** You can view these VM settings in VirtualBox Manager, in the Settings
   window, and by running the VBoxManage command.
** See _8 VBoxManage_.

Guest Additions.::
** This refers to special software packages which are shipped with Oracle
   VirtualBox but designed to be installed inside a VM to improve performance
   of the guest OS and to add extra features.
** See _4 Guest Additions_.

== 1.6 Starting Oracle VirtualBox

* After installation, you can start Oracle VirtualBox as follows:
Linux or Oracle Solaris hosts::
** Depending on your desktop environment, an Oracle VirtualBox item may have
   been placed in either the System or System Tools group of your Applications
   menu.
** Alternatively, you can enter VirtualBox in a terminal window.
** When you start Oracle VirtualBox, the VirtualBox Manager interface is shown.
** See _1.7 Configuring Oracle VirtualBox_.

== 1.8 Adding Virtual Machines

* If you want to create a completely new VM, click New and follow the steps in
  _1.9 Creating a Virtual Machine_.
* If you already have a VM saved on your machine, you can add it to the machine
  list by clicking Add.
* If you have a VM on a different machine, you can import it by clicking Import
  Appliance.
* See _1.15.2 Importing an Appliance in OVF Format_.
* If you want to view an OCI instance from within VirtualBox Manager, see
  _1.16.7.3 Adding a Cloud VM_.

== 1.9 Creating a Virtual Machine

* In the VirtualBox Manager window, click New.
* The Create Virtual Machine workflow is shown, to guide you through the
  required steps for setting up a new virtual machine (VM).

'''

* The steps are:
** _1.9.1 Specify Name and Operating System_
** _1.9.2 Configure Unattended Guest OS Install_
** _1.9.3 Set Up VM Hardware_
** _1.9.4 Specify a Virtual Hard Disk_

'''
 
* The exact settings on the workflow pages depend on the architecture of the
  host platform.

'''

* If you don't see the workflow, change the experience level to Basic.
* See _1.7.2 Experience Levels for VirtualBox Manager_.

'''

* Once created, the virtual machine is displayed in the machine list on the
  left side of the VirtualBox Manager window, with the name that you entered on
  the first page of the workflow.

'''

* You can change the settings later, after you have created the VM, using the
  Machine Settings.

'''

* You must supply an operating system image, in ISO format, for the operating
  system you intend to install on the VM.
* Oracle VirtualBox does not supply the OS or any license required to use it.

=== 1.9.1 Specify Name and Operating System

1. Give the virtual machine (VM) a name.
* The name you enter is shown in the machine list in VirtualBox Manager and is
  also used for the virtual machine's files on disk.
* Be sure to assign each VM an informative name that describes the OS and
  software running on the VM.
* For example, `Windows 10 with Visio`.
* The name is also used to help Oracle VirtualBox suggest the appropriate OS
  and related field contents automatically.

2. Select the location where VMs are stored on your computer, called the
   machine folder.
* Ensure that the folder location has enough free space, especially if you
  intend to use the snapshots feature.
* See also _10.1.1 The Machine Folder_.

3. Select the ISO image file for the operating system you intend to install on
   the new VM.
* The image file can be used directly to install an OS on the new VM as part of
  an unattended installation, or it can be attached to a DVD drive on the new
  VM.
* If the image contains more than one edition, select the edition you want to
  use.

4. Oracle VirtualBox will populate the Type, Subtype, and Version fields if it
   can detect the operating system in the ISO.
* If it cannot detect the OS, then set these according to your OS.
* For example, if the Type is Linux, the Subtype might be Oracle Linux and the
  Version might be Oracle Linux 8.x (64-bit).
* The options available for the guest OS are also limited by the host
  architecture.
* See _3.1 Guest Operating Systems_ for more information.
+
'''

* The supported OSs are grouped into types.
* If you want to install something very unusual that is not listed, select the
  Other type.
* Depending on your selection, Oracle VirtualBox will enable or disable certain
  VM settings that your guest OS may require.
* This is particularly important for 64-bit guests (see _3.1.5 64-bit Guests
  on) but you must always set this field to the correct value.

5. By default, Oracle VirtualBox will install the chosen OS using the ISO image
   provided, if the image supports unattended installation.
* See also _1.9.2 Configure Unattended Guest OS Install_.
+
'''

* If you prefer to install the OS manually, you can disable the unattended
  guest operating system install feature by selecting Skip Unattended
  Installation.
* In that case, the selected ISO image is mounted automatically on the DVD
  drive of the new VM and you must install the OS from there.
* Not all images support unattended installation.

6. Click Next to _1.9.2 Configure Unattended Guest OS Install_ (if using) or to
   _1.9.3 Set Up VM Hardware_.

=== 1.9.2 Configure Unattended Guest OS Install

* If you choose Unattended guest OS Installation, Oracle VirtualBox installs
  the OS on the new virtual machine (VM) automatically.
* You must supply certain configuration options to be used in the installation.
* See also _3.2.1 Using VBoxManage Commands for Unattended Guest Installation_
  for details of how to configure unattended installation from the command
  line.

[NOTE]
====
* You will not see these options if you selected the Skip Unattended
  Installation option.
====

1. Enter the *Username and Password* for a default user on the guest OS.
2. For Windows guests, enter the *Product Key* supplied with Windows.
3. Enter the *Hostname* for the VM. +
   By default, this is the same as the VM name.
4. Enter the *Domain Name* for the VM.
5. Select *Install in Background* if you want to enable headless mode for the
   VM rather than using a graphical user interface.
6. Unattended Guest Additions installation is available for some x86 guests. +
   Select Guest Additions if you would like Oracle VirtualBox to install the
   Guest Additions after the OS. +
   Download the Guest Additions installation ISO to the host, and select the
   file location. +
7. Click Next to _1.9.3 Set Up VM Hardware_

=== 1.9.3 Set Up VM Hardware

1. For *Base Memory*, select the amount of RAM that Oracle VirtualBox should
   allocate to the virtual machine (VM) every time it is started.
* The guest OS will report this size as the VM's installed RAM.
+
'''
+
[CAUTION]
====
* Choose this setting carefully.
* The memory you give to the VM will not be available to your host OS while the
  VM is running.
====
+
* Do not specify more than you can spare, whilst ensuring you allocate enough
  for your guest OS and applications to run properly.
* For example, if your host machine has 4 GB of RAM and you enter 2048 MB as
  the base memory for a VM, you will have 2 GB left for all the other software
  on your host while that VM is running.
+
'''
+
* A guest OS may require at least 1 or 2 GB of memory to install and boot up.
* If you intend to run more than one VM at a time, plan accordingly.
* A VM will not start if it does not have enough RAM to boot.
+
'''

* Always ensure that the host OS has enough RAM remaining.
* If insufficient RAM remains, the system might excessively swap memory to the
  hard disk, which will effectively bring the host system to a standstill.

2. For *Processor(s)*, select the number of virtual processors to assign to the
   VM.
* Do not assign more than half of the total processor threads from the host
  machine.

3. Select *Enable EFI* if you want to enable Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI)
   booting for the guest OS.
4. Click Next to _1.9.4 Specify a Virtual Hard Disk_.

=== 1.9.4 Specify a Virtual Hard Disk

* There are many ways in which Oracle VirtualBox can provide hard disk space
  to a VM, see _5 Virtual Storage_.

'''

* The most common way is to use a virtual hard disk.
* This is a large image file on your physical hard disk, whose contents Oracle
  VirtualBox presents to your VM as if it were a complete hard disk.
* You can copy this file to another host, and use it with another Oracle
  VirtualBox VM.

'''

[NOTE]
====
* If you choose *Do Not Add a Virtual Hard Disk* at this stage you will need to
  attach a hard disk using VirtualBox Manager or VBoxManage commands before
  you can install a guest operating system.
====

==== Create a Virtual Hard Disk

* Follow these steps to create a virtual hard disk to use with this VM.
* To prevent your physical hard disk on the host OS from filling up, Oracle
  VirtualBox limits the size of the image file.
* But the image file must be large enough to hold the contents of the guest OS
  and the applications you want to install.
* For a Windows or Linux guest, you will probably need several gigabytes for
  any serious use.
* The limit of the image file size can be changed later, see _8.33 VBoxManage
  modifymedium_.

1. Select *Create a Virtual Hard Disk Now*.
** This creates a new empty virtual hard disk image, located in the VM's
   machine folder.
2. Enter the following settings:
Disk Size.::
** Use the slider to select a maximum size for the hard disk in the new VM.
Pre-Allocate Full Size.::
** This setting determines the type of image file used for the disk image.
** Select this setting to use a fixed-size file for the disk image.
** Otherwise, Oracle VirtualBox will use a dynamically allocated file for the
   disk image.
'''

* The different types of image file behave as follows:
Dynamically allocated file.::
* This type of image file only grows in size when the guest actually stores
  data on its virtual hard disk.
* Therefore, this file is small initially.
* As the drive is filled with data, the file grows to the specified size.
Fixed-size file.::
* This type of image file immediately occupies the file specified, even if
  only a fraction of that virtual hard disk space is actually in use.
* While occupying much more space, a fixed-size file incurs less overhead and
  is therefore slightly faster than a dynamically allocated file.

* For more details about the differences, see _5.2 Disk Image Files (VDI,
  VMDK, VHD, HDD)_.

==== Use an Existing Virtual Hard Disk

* Follow these steps to use a virtual hard disk that already exists on the
  host.
* Ensure the image file is in a suitable location (usually the machine folder)
  and not in use by other VMs.

[CAUTION]
====
* Data on the disk image may be deleted.
====

1. Select *Use an Existing Virtual Hard Disk File*
2. Select the image file to use with the new VM, and then click *Add*.

== 1.10 Running a Virtual Machine

* To start a virtual machine (VM), you have the following options:
** Double-click the VM's name in the machine list in VirtualBox Manager.
** Select the VM's name in the machine list in VirtualBox Manager, and click
   *Start* in the toolbar the top of the window.
** Go to the VirtualBox VMs folder in your system user's home directory.
   +
   Find the subdirectory of the machine you want to start and double-click the
   machine settings file. +
   This file has a `.vbox` file extension.

'''

* The VM you started appears in a new window and you will see it start to boot
  up, or prompt you to install an operating system as required.
* Everything that would normally be seen on the virtual system's monitor is
  shown in the window.

'''

* In general, you can use the virtual machine as you would use a real
  computer.
* The following topics describe a few points to note when running a VM.

=== 1.10.1 Starting a New VM for the First Time

* When you start a VM for the first time the OS installation process is
  started automatically, using the ISO image file specified in the *Create
  Virtual Machine* workflow.

'''

* Follow the onscreen instructions to install your OS.
