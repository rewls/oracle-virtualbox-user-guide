= Chapter 3 Configuring Virtual Machines

* This chapter provides detailed steps for configuring an Oracle VM VirtualBox
  virtual machine (VM).
* For an introduction to Oracle VM VirtualBox and steps to get your first
  virtual machine running, see Chapter 1, _First Steps_.

'''

* You have considerable latitude when deciding what virtual hardware to
  provide to the guest.
* Use virtual hardware to communicate with the host system or with other
  guests.
* For example, you can use virtual hardware in the following ways:
** Have Oracle VM VirtualBox present an ISO CD-ROM image to a guest system as
   if it were a physical CD-ROM.
** Provide a guest system access to the physical network through its virtual
   network card.
** Provide the host system, other guests, and computers on the Internet access
   to the guest system.

== 3.9. Network Settings

* The Network section in a virtual machine's Settings window enables you to
  configure how Oracle VM VirtualBox presents virtual network cards to your
  VM, and how they operate.

'''

* When you first create a virtual machine, Oracle VM VirtualBox by default
  enables one virtual network card and selects the Network Address Translation
  (NAT) mode for it.
* This way the guest can connect to the outside world using the host's
  networking and the outside world can connect to services on the guest which
  you choose to make visible outside of the virtual machine.

'''

* This default setup is good for the majority of Oracle VM VirtualBox users.
* However, Oracle VM VirtualBox is extremely flexible in how it can virtualize
  networking.
* It supports many virtual network cards per virtual machine.
* The first four virtual network cards can be configured in detail in the
  VirtualBox Manager window.
* Additional network cards can be configured using the *VBoxManage* command.

'''

* Many networking options are available.
* See Chapter 6, _Virtual Networking_ for more information.
