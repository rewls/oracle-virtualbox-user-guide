= Chapter 6 Virtual Networking
:experimental:

* As mentioned in Section 3.9, “Network Settings”, Oracle VM VirtualBox
  provides up to eight virtual PCI Ethernet cards for each virtual machine.
* For each such card, you can individually select the following:
** The hardware that will be virtualized.
** The virtualization mode that the virtual card operates in, with respect to
   your physical networking hardware on the host.

* Four of the network cards can be configured in the menu:Network[] section of the
  menu:Settings[] dialog in the graphical user interface of Oracle VM VirtualBox.
* You can configure all eight network cards on the command line using
  *VBoxManage modifyvm*.
* See Section 7.8, “VBoxManage modifyvm”.

* This chapter explains the various networking settings in more detail.

== 6.2. Introduction to Networking Modes

* Each of the networking adapters can be separately configured to operate in
  one of the following modes:

'''

Not attached.::
* In this mode, Oracle VM VirtualBox reports to the guest that a network card
  is present, but that there is no connection.
* This is as if no Ethernet cable was plugged into the card.
* Using this mode, it is possible to pull the virtual Ethernet cable and
  disrupt the connection, which can be useful to inform a guest operating
  system that no network connection is available and enforce a reconfiguration.

Network Address Translation (NAT).::
* If all you want is to browse the Web, download files, and view email inside
  the guest, then this default mode should be sufficient for you, and you can
  skip the rest of this section.
* Please note that there are certain limitations when using Windows file
  sharing.
* See Section 6.3.3, "NAT Limitations".

NAT Network.::
* A NAT network is a type of internal network that allows outbound
  connections.
* See Section 6.4, "Network Address Translation Service".

Bridged networking.::
* This is for more advanced networking needs, such as network simulations and
  running servers in a guest.
* When enabled, Oracle VM VirtualBox connects to one of your installed network
  cards and exchanges network packets directly, circumventing your host
  operating system's network stack.

Internal networking.::
* This can be used to create a different kind of software-based network which
  is visible to selected virtual machines, but not to applications running on
  the host or to the outside world.

Host-only networking.::
* This can be used to create a network containing the host and a set of
  virtual machines, without the need for the host's physical network
  interface.
* Instead, a virtual network interface, similar to a loopback interface, is
  created on the host, providing connectivity among virtual machines and the
  host.

Generic networking.::
* Rarely used modes which share the same generic network interface, by
  allowing the user to select a driver which can be included with Oracle VM
  VirtualBox or be distributed in an extension pack.

* The following sub-modes are available:
UDP Tunnel::
* Used to interconnect virtual machines running on different hosts directly,
  easily, and transparently, over an existing network infrastructure.

VDE (Virtual Distributed Ethernet) networking::
* Used to connect to a Virtual Distributed Ethernet switch on a Linux or a
  FreeBSD host.
* At the moment this option requires compilation of Oracle VM VirtualBox from
  sources, as the Oracle packages do not include it.

* The following table provides an overview of the most important networking
  modes.
